### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing a merge request it is asked to mark the comments priority. We chose to use emojis to represent the following:

:apple: : "must be fixed"
:orange_book:: "personal taste, but should probably be fixed"
:green_apple: : "style questions, white spaces, etc"

Gitlab text replacements for these emojis:

:apple:  `:apple:`
:orange_book:    `:orange_book:`
:green_apple:    `:green_apple:`
