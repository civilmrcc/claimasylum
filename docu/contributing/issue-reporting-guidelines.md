### Issue Reporting Guidelines

Please report all issues in the [issue page](https://gitlab.com/mareikei/claimasylum/issues). There make sure that the bug or feature was not already reported, or please link dublicated cards together.

Write detailed information because it is very helpful to understand an issue. For example:

- How to reproduce the issue, step-by-step.
- The expected behavior.
- What is actually happening (or what is wrong)?
- The operating system.
- Screenshots always help a lot.
